# LootManager
Modify loot tables for Unturned. (RocketMod plugin)

## How to use
On server load or plugin reload, the plugin will scan the maps' tables and put them into its own config, then you can edit those tables and toggle which things the plugin should modify.
Restart server or `/rocket reload LootManager` and it should be able to modify the spawntables!
"tableID" seems to be the same as "itemID" for most things, so try editing that.
